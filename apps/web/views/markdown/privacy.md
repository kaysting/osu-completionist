# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 2, 2026

At **osu!complete**, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store your information when you use our completionist tracking service.

## 1. Information We Collect
We do not ask for your email address or password. We collect data solely through the **osu! API** when you log in via OAuth or when your profile is queued for an update.

### A. Automatically Collected Data
* **osu! Profile:** User ID, Username, Avatar URL, Cover URL, Country, and Team information.
* **Game Stats:** Your history of passed beatmaps, play counts, and score timestamps.

### B. Technical Data
* **Logs:** We may log IP addresses and request timestamps for security purposes (e.g., to prevent abuse or DDoS attacks).
* **Cookies:** We use cookies to maintain your login session (`token`) and to save your preferences between pages during your current browsing session (`osucomplete.sid`). We do not use third-party tracking cookies.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use your data for the following specific purposes:
* **Core Functionality:** To calculate your "Completion %" across different categories (e.g., Ranked, Loved).
* **Leaderboards:** To display your rank relative to other users on the site.
* **Historical Analytics:** To generate visuals showing your completion progress over time.
* **API Access:** To allow you to generate and use an API key for programmatic access.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention
Your data is stored in our database to allow for historical tracking.
* **Public Visibility:** By design, your completion stats and profile information are public and viewable by anyone on the website, similar to your profile on the official osu! website.
* **Data Source:** We do not own your game data. We act as an aggregator of data provided publicly by the osu! API.

## 4. Third-Party Services
* **osu!:** Our service relies entirely on the osu! API. We encourage you to review the [osu! Privacy Policy](https://osu.ppy.sh/legal/privacy).
* **Discord:** While we use Discord webhooks for surface level progress and error logging, no personally identifiable information (PII) is sent to Discord other than generic error details, your osu! user ID, or username.

## 5. Your Rights (Data Deletion)
You have the right to have your data removed from osu!complete.

* **Opt-Out:** If you wish to stop tracking your progress and remove your history from our database, please contact Kayla on Discord **@kaysting** or via email, **kayla@kaysting.dev**.
* **Effect:** Upon request, we will irreversibly delete all data associated with you from the osu!complete database. Note that this does not affect the data stored by osu!, and you should contact them as per their Privacy Policy should you seek data removal from there. You may log back in at any time to restore your data from the osu! servers.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
