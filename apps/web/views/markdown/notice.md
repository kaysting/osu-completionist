Hi! Thanks for checking out osu!complete.

This project is still in beta and thus is under active development. Bugs are constantly being discovered and fixed, and improvements are always being implemented. With active development comes a risk of instability, data loss, and other issues, but a best effort is being made to mitigate these risks and keep everything in order. Please make yourself at home while keeping these risks in mind.

Your feedback is extremely important in this phase of development, so if you'd like to contribute your thoughts or keep up with progress, join the Discord server using the link below.

Here's to creating the best osu! completionist tracker out there!
