### Introducing the new navigation system and categories!

Happy February!

Recently, you might have noticed the new sidebar navigation style that replaced the topbar nav. This allows for us to show more useful navigation links and information at a glance while ensuring everything is accessible and responsive to all screen sizes.

We also introduced a new category selector that lives in the top bar and stays pinned to the top of the screen when you scroll. This icon-based selector is more visually appealing than the previous category selection buttons and it allowed us to implement some new categories!

You'll notice four buttons next to the mode selectors (or just two with osu!standard selected). These are all toggles for including/excluding ranked statuses and converts/specifics:

- **Check mark (green):** Toggle including ranked and approved maps.
- **Heart (pink):** Toggle including loved maps.
- **Target (blue):** Toggle specifics in modes other than standard. These are maps that were made specifically for a certain mode (not converts).
- **Circle with arrows (yellow):** Toggle converts in modes other than standard. These are maps that were converted from standard to a certain mode.

Specifically, the new categories introduced are **loved only** and **converts only**.

Note that these new categories will have unpopulated history graphs since they haven't existed until now.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions with these new features, please feel free to [join the Discord server](/discord) and talk to Kayla.

### Added a dynamic render for primary category stats

Another great addition to your osu! me! section, we now offer dynamic renders for the main stats of a selected category.

You can access it and copy its BBCode using the same **share & embed** menu on your profile.

_Edit: The design of this render has been updated and country and team flags, as well as category rank have been added to both this and the per-year render._

### New share menu!

Hi again! Today we've revamped the profile sharing system. You'll notice a new button on top of your profile banner labeled **share & embed**, which, when clicked, opens a new fancy popup providing various options for sharing your completion stats.

The existing plain text stats can still be copied as before, but we now offer a dynamically updating image render of your yearly stats in a selected category. These renders are ideal for putting in your osu! me! section to rep your stats (and help promote osu!complete), and even have the option to customize the background color to match your osu! profile.

We highly encourage you to make use of this feature since it beats manually updating your stats as text in your profile whenever you remember to. Check it out!

### Welcome to the changelog popup!

Hi! You're seeing this popup because new features have been added and this is the easiest way for us to let you know about them. This'll pop back up every time there are new features worth mentioning.
