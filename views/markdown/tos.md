# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** January 2, 2026

Welcome to **osu!complete** ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our website, API, or services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our services.

## 1. Unofficial Status
osu!complete is an unofficial, open-source fan project designed to track completion statistics for the rhythm game *osu!*.

We are **not** affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved by **ppy Pty Ltd** (the creators of osu!). All game data, including beatmaps and user scores, is the intellectual property of ppy Pty Ltd or its respective creators.

## 2. API and Data Usage
We provide a public API for developers to access completion data. To protect our database and server resources, you agree to the following usage rules:

* **Rate Limits:** We enforce strict rate limits on both API usage and website navigation. These limits are subject to change at any time without prior notice to ensure the stability of the service.
* **No Scraping:** You agree not to use automated scripts, scrapers, or crawlers to harvest data in bulk from our website or API for the purpose of replicating our database.
* **Attribution:** If you use data from osu!complete in your own project, you must provide a visible link back to [osucomplete.org](https://osucomplete.org).

We reserve the right to revoke API keys or ban IP addresses that circumvent these limits or abuse our infrastructure.

## 3. User Accounts
osu!complete uses **osu! OAuth** for authentication. We do not manage passwords. By logging in, you authorize us to access your public osu! profile data (username, ID, avatar, country) to generate your statistics.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your osu! account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account.

## 4. Intellectual Property
* **Game Assets:** All osu! related assets (including but not limited to ruleset icons, beatmap metadata, and game branding) remain the property of ppy Pty Ltd.
* **Source Code:** The source code for osu!complete is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaysting/osu-completionist). It is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
* **Aggregated Data:** The specific compilation of completion statistics and historical data generated by osu!complete are proprietary to this service.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties
The service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that the data (which relies on the external osu! API) will always be perfectly accurate.

## 6. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.
